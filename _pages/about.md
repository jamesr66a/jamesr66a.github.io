James K. Reed is an experienced software engineer with hands-on experience in programming languages, compiler design, and deep learning platforms. He is fascinated by the whole computing stack from programming interface down to silicon, and seeks to investigate the intersection of these as the newest AI revolution drives High-Performance Computing (HPC) innovation.


At his current role at [fireworks.ai](fireworks.ai), James is applying his skills to build a high-performance service for customized Large Language Model (LLM) workloads. Before this, James worked with the PyTorch team at Meta (formerly Facebook) as a Staff Software Engineer, where he led development of toolkits including [torch.fx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08429), [PiPPy](https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy), [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html), and [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/). He completed his Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech, graduating Summa Cum Laude.

You can follow James's work on his [GitHub](https://github.com/jamesr66a/) profile and connect with him on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesr66a/). James has published [academic papers, patents and blog posts](/publications) and has given several [talks](/speaking).
